# Introduction

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a key method for assessing the validity of a measurement instrument through its internal structure [@bandalos2018; @hughes2018; @sireci2013]. Validity is arguably the most crucial characteristic of a measurement model [@furr2021], as it addresses the essential question of what measuring instruments truly assess [@bandalos2018]. This concern is closely linked with the classical definition of validity: the degree to which a test measures what it claims to measure [@bandalos2018; @furr2021; @sireci2013; @urbina2014], aligning with the tripartite model still embraced by numerous scholars [@widodo2018].

The tripartite model of validity frames the concept using three categories of evidence: content, criterion, and construct [@bandalos2018]. Content validity pertains to the adequacy and representativeness of test items relative to the domain or objective under investigation [@cohen2022]. Criterion validity is the correlation between test outcomes and a significant external criterion, such as performance on another measure or future occurrences [@cohen2022]. Construct validity evaluates the test's capacity to measure the theoretical construct it is intended to assess, taking into account related hypotheses and empirical data [@cohen2022].

Introduced in the American Psychological Association (APA) "Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing" in 1966, the tripartite concept of validity has been a cornerstone in the social sciences for decades [@bandalos2018]. However, its fragmented and confusing nature has led to widespread criticism, prompting a shift towards a more holistic view of validity [@sireci2013]. This evolution was signified by the publication of the 1999 standards [@aera1999], and further by the 2014 standards [@aera2014], which redefined test validity in terms of the interpretations and uses of test scores [@furr2021]. Under this new paradigm, validation requires diverse theoretical and empirical evidence, recognizing validity as a unified concept – construct validity – encompassing various evidence sources for evaluating potential interpretations of test scores for specific purposes [@furr2021; @urbina2014].

Thus, key authorities in psychological assessment now define validity as the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for their intended purposes [@aera2014]. Validity involves a comprehensive evaluation of how well empirical evidence and theoretical rationales uphold the conclusions and actions derived from test scores or other assessment types [@bandalos2018; @furr2021; @urbina2014].

According to APA guidelines [@aera2014], five types of validity evidence are critical: content, response process, association with external variables, consequences of test use, and internal structure. Content validity examines the extent to which test content accurately represents the domain of interest exclusively [@furr2021]. The response process refers to the link between the construct and the specifics of the examinees' responses [@sireci2013]. Validity based on external variables concerns the test's correlation with other measures or constructs expected to be related or unrelated to the evaluated construct [@furr2021]. The implications of test use focus on the positive or negative effects on the individuals or groups assessed [@bandalos2018].

Evidence based on internal structure assesses how well the interactions among test items and their components align with the theoretical framework used to explain the outcomes of the measurement instrument [@aera2014; @rios2014]. Sources of internal structural validity evidence may include analyses of reliability, dimensionality, and measurement invariance.

Reliability is gauged by internal consistency, reflecting i) the reproducibility of test scores under consistent conditions and ii) the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance [@rios2014]. Dimensionality analysis aims to verify if item interrelations support the inferences made by the measurement model's scores, which are assumed to be unidimensional [@rios2014]. Measurement invariance confirms that item properties remain consistent across specified groups, such as gender or ethnicity.

CFA facilitates the integration of these diverse sources to substantiate the validity of the internal structure [@bandalos2018; @flora2017; @hughes2018; @reeves2016; @rios2014]. In the applied social sciences, researchers often have a theoretical dimensional structure in mind [@sireci2013], and CFA is employed to align the structure of the hypothesized measurement model with the observed data [@rios2014].

CFA constitutes a fundamental aspect of the covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework (CB-SEM) [@brown2023; @harrington2009; @jackson2009; @kline2023; @nye2022]. SEM is a prevalent statistical approach in the applied social sciences [@hoyle2023cap1; @kline2023], serving as a generalization of multiple regression and factor analysis [@hoyle2023cap1]. This methodology facilitates the examination of complex relationships between variables and the consideration of measurement error, aligning with the requirements for measurement model validation [@hoyle2023cap1].

Applications of CFA present significant complexities [@crede2019; @flake2017; @flake2020; @jackson2009; @nye2022; @rogers2024], influenced by data structure, measurement level of items, research goals, and other factors. CFA can proceed smoothly in scenarios involving unidimensional measurement models with continuous items and large samples, but may encounter challenges, such as diminished SEM flexibility, when dealing with multidimensional models with ordinal items and small sample sizes [@rogers2024].

This leads to an important question: Can certain strategies within CFA applications simplify the process for social scientists seeking evidence of validity in the internal structure of a measurement model? This inquiry does not suggest that research objectives should conform to quantitative methods. Rather, research aims guide scientific inquiry, defining our learning targets and priorities. Quantitative methods serve as tools towards these ends, not as objectives themselves. They represent one among many tools available to researchers, with the study's purpose dictating method selection [@pilcher2023].

However, as the scientific method is an ongoing journey of discovery, many questions, especially in Psychometrics concerning measurement model validation, remain open-ended. The lack of consensus on complex and varied topics suggests researchers should opt for paths offering maximal analytical flexibility, enabling exploration of diverse methodologies and solutions while keeping research objectives forefront [@price2017].

A recurrent topic in Factor Analysis (FA) is how to handle the measurement level of scale items. Empirical studies [@rhemtulla2012; @robitzsch2022; @robitzsch2020] advocating for the treatment of scales with five or more response options as continuous variables have shown to enhance CFA flexibility and address validity evidence for the internal structure. The FA literature acknowledges methodological dilemmas faced when dealing with binary and/or ordinal response items with fewer than five options [@rogers2024; @rogers2022].

For continuous scale items, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and its robust variations are applicable. For non-continuous items, estimators from the Least Squares (cat-LS) family are recommended [@nye2022; @rogers2024; @rogers2022]. Though cat-LS estimators impose fewer assumptions on data, they require larger sample sizes, more computational power, and greater researcher expertise [@robitzsch2020].

Assessing model fit is more challenging with cat-LS estimated models compared to those estimated by ML, which are better established and more familiar to researchers [@rhemtulla2012]. Despite their increasing popularity, cat-LS models are newer, less recognized, and seldom available in software [@rhemtulla2012]. Handling missing data remains straightforward with ML models using the Full Information ML (FIML) method but is problematic with ordinal data [@rogers2024].

Thus, we can optimize the potential of some of the available software [@arbuckle2019; @bentler2020; @fox2022; @jasp2023; @joreskog2022; @muthen2023; @neale2016; @ringle2022; @rosseel2012; @jamovi2023] and overcome many of the limitations for ordinal and nominal data, which are still present in some of them [@arbuckle2019; @bentler2020; @neale2016; @ringle2022].

This discussion does not intend to oversimplify, digress, or claim superiority of one software over another. Rather, it underscores a fundamental statistical principle: transitioning from nominal to ordinal and then to scalar measurement levels increases the flexibility of statistical methods. Empirical studies in CFA support these clarifications [@rhemtulla2012; @robitzsch2022; @robitzsch2020].

This article assists applied social scientists in decision-making from selecting a measurement model to comparing and updating models for enhanced CFA flexibility. It addresses power analysis, data preprocessing, estimation procedures, and model modification from three angles: smart choices or recommended practices [@flake2017; @nye2022; @rogers2024], pitfalls to avoid [@crede2019; @rogers2024], and essential reporting elements [@flake2020; @jackson2009; @rogers2024].

The aim is to guide researchers through CFA to access the underlying structure of measurement models without falling into common traps at any stage of the validation process. Early-stage decisions can preempt later limitations, while missteps may necessitate exploratory research or additional efforts in subsequent phases.

Practically, this includes an R tutorial utilizing the lavaan package [@rosseel2012], adhering to reproducibility, replicability, and transparency standards of the Open Science movement [@gilroy2019; @kathawalla2021; @klein2018].

Tutorial articles, following the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) [@wilkinson2016], play a vital role in promoting open science [@martins2021; @mendes-da-silva2023], by detailing significant methods or application areas in an accessible yet comprehensive manner. This encourages adherence to best practices among researchers, minimizing the impact of positive publication bias.

This tutorial is structured into three sections, beyond the introductory discussion. It includes a thorough review of CFA recommended practices, an example of real-world research application in the R ecosystem, and final considerations, following @martins2021 format for tutorial articles. This approach, combined with workflow recommendations for reproducibility, aims to support the applied social sciences community in effectively utilizing CFA [@martins2021; @mendes-da-silva2023].
