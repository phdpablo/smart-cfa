  abstract = {ABSTRACT This study sought to investigate the relationship between diversification, financial well-being (FWB), quality of life (QoL), and mental health, and to see how FWB mediates this relationship, considering a sample of 1,047 Brazilian investors registered with the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (Comiss{\~a}o de Valores Mobili{\'a}rios [CVM]). In the national and international literature, no studies were found that sought to identify the mediating role of FWB between diversification, QoL, and mental health, as proposed in this study. This research may help brokers and financial institutions, allowing a new look at the profile of investors and their portfolios. It also widens the perspectives on studies of personal finance and mental health in Brazil and around the world. Mediation was conducted through structural equation modeling estimated by robust diagonally weighted least squares (RDWLS). `Asset classes' was adopted as a proxy for diversification. For QoL, the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-100) scale was adopted, while the Beck inventories were used to measure mental health (depression and anxiety). For FWB, the measure of the Brazilian Credit Protection Service (Servi{\c c}o de Prote{\c c}{\~a}o ao Cr{\'e}dito [SPC Brasil]) was used. The results showed a strong relationship between the FWB mediation between the diversification degree (asset classes) and the QoL and mental health scales (anxiety and depression). It was found that the diversification level is related to increased levels of anxiety and depression and decreased QoL in the short term, but when mediated by FWB, it decreases the anxiety and depression levels and increases QoL.RESUMO Este trabalho buscou investigar a rela{\c c}{\~a}o entre diversifica{\c c}{\~a}o, bem-estar financeiro (BEF) e qualidade de vida (QV) e sa{\'u}de mental, e compreender como o BEF medeia essa rela{\c c}{\~a}o, considerando uma amostra de 1.047 investidores brasileiros cadastrados na Comiss{\~a}o de Valores Mobili{\'a}rios (CVM). Na literatura nacional e internacional, n{\~a}o foram encontrados estudos que buscassem identificar o papel mediador do BEF entre a diversifica{\c c}{\~a}o e a QV e a sa{\'u}de mental, como se prop{\~o}e neste estudo. Esta pesquisa pode auxiliar corretoras e institui{\c c}{\~o}es financeiras, possibilitando um novo olhar sobre o perfil dos investidores e suas carteiras. Ainda, amplia as perspectivas sobre os estudos de finan{\c c}as pessoais e sa{\'u}de mental no Brasil e no mundo. A media{\c c}{\~a}o foi realizada por modelagem de equa{\c c}{\~o}es estruturais estimada por m{\'i}nimos quadrados robustos ponderados na diagonal (robust diagonally weighted least squares [RDWLS]). Como proxy de diversifica{\c c}{\~a}o, adotou-se ``classes de ativos''. Para QV, adotou-se a escala World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-100), enquanto para mensurar sa{\'u}de mental (depress{\~a}o e ansiedade) usaram-se os invent{\'a}rios de Beck. Para BEF, utilizou-se a medida do Servi{\c c}o de Prote{\c c}{\~a}o ao Cr{\'e}dito (SPC) do Brasil. Os resultados apontaram forte rela{\c c}{\~a}o de media{\c c}{\~a}o do BEF entre o grau de diversifica{\c c}{\~a}o (classes de ativos) e as escalas de QV e sa{\'u}de mental (ansiedade e depress{\~a}o). Constatou-se que o n{\'i}vel de diversifica{\c c}{\~a}o est{\'a} relacionado com o aumento dos n{\'i}veis de ansiedade e depress{\~a}o e com a redu{\c c}{\~a}o da QV no curto prazo, mas, quando mediado pelo BEF, reduz os n{\'i}veis de ansiedade e depress{\~a}o e aumenta a QV.},

Conditions manipulated include model misspecification, level of asymmetry, level and categorization, sample size, and type and size of the model. Results indicate that cat-DWLS estimation method results in the least parameter estimate and standard error bias under the majority of conditions studied. Cat-DWLS parameter estimates and standard errors were generally the least affected by model misspecification of the estimation methods studied. Robust ML also performed well, yielding relatively unbiased parameter estimates and standard errors. However, both cat-DWLS and robust ML resulted in low power under conditions of high data asymmetry, small sample sizes, and mild model misspecification. For more optimal conditions, power for these estimators was adequate. {\copyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

A coefficient omega index estimates how reliably an observed composite score measures a target construct as represented by a factor in a factor-analysis model; as such, the accuracy of omega estimates is likely to depend on correct model specification. The current paper presents a simulation study to investigate the performance of omega-unidimensional (based on the parameters of a one-factor model) and omega-hierarchical (based on a bifactor model) under correct and incorrect model misspecification for high and low reliability composites and different scale lengths. Our results show that coefficient omega estimates are unbiased when calculated from the parameter estimates of a properly specified model. However, omega-unidimensional produced positively biased estimates when the population model was characterized by unmodeled error correlations or multidimensionality, whereas omega-hierarchical was only slightly biased when the population model was either a one-factor model with correlated errors or a higher-order model. These biases were higher when population reliability was lower and increased with scale length. Researchers should carefully evaluate the feasibility of a one-factor model before estimating and reporting omega-unidimensional.},

  abstract = {The current guidelines for estimating reliability recommend using two omega combinations in multidimensional data. One omega is for factor analysis (FA) reliability estimators, and the other omega is for omega hierarchical estimators (i.e., {$\omega$}h). This study challenges these guidelines. Specifically, the following three questions are asked: (a) Do FA reliability estimators outperform non-FA reliability estimators? (b) Is it always desirable to estimate {$\omega$}h? (c) What are the best reliability and {$\omega$}h estimators? This study addresses these issues through a Monte Carlo simulation of reliability and {$\omega$}h estimators. The conclusions are given as follows. First, the performance differences among most reliability estimators are small, and the performance of FA estimators is comparable to that of non-FA estimators. However, the current, most-recommended estimators, that is, estimators based on the bifactor model and exploratory factor analysis, tend to overestimate reliability. Second, the accuracy of {$\omega$}h estimators is much lower than that of reliability estimators, so we should perform {$\omega$}h estimation selectively only on data that meet several requirements. Third, exploratory bifactor analysis is more accurate than confirmatory bifactor analysis only in the presence of cross-loading; otherwise, exploratory bifactor analysis is less accurate than confirmatory bifactor analysis. Fourth, techniques known to improve the Schmid-Leiman (SL) transformation are not superior to SL transformation but have different advantages. This study provides an R Shiny app that allows users to obtain multidimensional reliability and {$\omega$}h estimates with a few mouse clicks.},

Addressing this issue, the present article presents -- in non-technical language -- the most basic concepts related to SEM, resolves common misconceptions about the method's application and provides hands-on advice to IMM authors and reviewers dealing with SEM-based manuscripts. Structured along ten fundamental questions, the article covers issues related to (1) latent variables and their scaling, (2) types of parameters in SEM, (3) unstandardized and standardized estimates, (4) model identification, (5) model constraints, (6) model fit, (7) independence and saturated models, (8) modification indices, (9) nested models, and (10) equivalent models. After illustrating these concepts with the use of examples, the article concludes with a list of guidelines addressed both to IMM authors crafting manuscripts using SEM and the peers reviewing them.},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study's inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We provide a basic review of the data screening and assumption testing issues relevant to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis along with practical advice for conducting analyses that are sensitive to these concerns. Historically, factor analysis was developed for explaining the relationships among many continuous test scores, which led to the expression of the common factor model as a multivariate linear regression model with observed, continuous variables serving as dependent variables, and unobserved factors as the independent, explanatory variables. Thus, we begin our paper with a review of the assumptions for the common factor model and data screening issues as they pertain to the factor analysis of continuous observed variables. In particular, we describe how prin- ciples from regression diagnostics also apply to factor analysis. Next, because modern applications of factor analysis frequently involve the analysis of the individual items from a single test or questionnaire, an important focus of this paper is the factor analysis of items. Although the traditional linear factor model is well-suited to the analysis of con- tinuously distributed variables, commonly used item types, including Likert-type items, almost always produce dichotomous or ordered categorical variables. We describe how relationships among such items are often not well described by product-moment correla- tions, which has clear ramifications for the traditional linear factor analysis. An alternative, non-linear factor analysis using polychoric correlations has become more readily available to applied researchers and thus more popular. Consequently, we also review the assumptions and data-screening issues involved in this method.Throughout the paper, we demonstrate these procedures using an historic data set of nine cognitive ability variables. {\copyright} 2012 Flora, LaBrish and Chalmers.},

Primary among these misunderstandings is the very mathematical distinction between EFA and CFA. The current paper uses a brief example to illustrate the difference between the statistical models underlying EFA and CFA, both of which are particular instantiations of the more general common factor model.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Measurement quality has recently been highlighted as an important concern for advancing a cumulative psychological science. An implication is that researchers should move beyond mechanistically reporting coefficient alpha toward more carefully assessing the internal structure and reliability of multi-item scales. Yet a researcher may be discouraged upon discovering that a prominent alternative to alpha, namely, coefficient omega, can be calculated in a variety of ways. In this Tutorial, I alleviate this potential confusion by describing alternative forms of omega and providing guidelines for choosing an appropriate omega estimate pertaining to the measurement of a target construct represented with a confirmatory factor analysis model. Several applied examples demonstrate how to compute different forms of omega in R.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We argue that factor analysis should be conducted before calculating internal consistency estimates of reliability. If factor analysis indicates the assumptions underlying coefficient alpha are met, then it can be reported as a reliability coefficient. However, to the extent that items are multidimensional, alternative internal consistency reliability coefficients should be computed based on the parameter estimates of the factor model. Assuming a bifactor model evidenced good fit, and the measure was designed to assess a single construct, omega hierarchical-the proportion of variance of the total scores due to the general factor-should be presented. Omega-the proportion of variance of the total scores due to all factors-also should be reported in that it represents a more traditional view of reliability, although it is computed within a factor analytic framework. By presenting both these coefficients and potentially other omega coefficients, the reliability results are less likely to be misinterpreted.},

Two Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that multicollinearity can cause problems under certain conditions, specifically: (1) when multicollinearity is extreme, Type II error rates are generally unacceptably high (over 80\%), (2) when multicollinearity is between 0.6 and 0.8, Type II error rates can be substantial (greater than 50\% and frequently above 80\%) if composite reliability is weak, explained variance (R               2               ) is low, and sample size is relatively small. However, as reliability improves (0.80 or higher), explained variance R               2               reaches 0.75, and sample becomes relatively large, Type II error rates become negligible. (3) When multicollinearity is between 0.4 and 0.5, Type II error rates tend to be quite small, except when reliability is weak, R               2               is low, and sample size is small, in which case error rates can still be high (greater than 50\%). Methods for detecting and correcting multicollinearity are briefly discussed. However, since multicollinearity is difficult to manage after the fact, researchers should avoid problems by carefully managing the factors known to mitigate multicollinearity problems (particularly measurement error).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI \&gt; .950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., {$\chi$} \textsuperscript{2} , {$\chi$} \textsuperscript{2} / {$<$}italic{$>$}df{$<$}/italic{$>$} , CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account. We highlight tailored (or ``dynamic'') cutoffs as a way forward. We provide convenient tables with scenario-specific cutoffs as well as regression formulae to predict cutoffs tailored to the empirical setting of interest. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Yet methodologists have warned that {$\alpha$} is not an optimal measure of reliability relative to its more general form, McDonald's omega ({$\omega$}). Among other reasons, that the computation of {$\omega$} is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of {$\alpha$} versus {$\omega$}, we illustrate the computation of {$\omega$} using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and AMOS) and the MBESS package for R. We then describe a macro for SPSS and SAS (OMEGA) that calculates {$\omega$} in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using CFA. We show that it produces estimates of {$\omega$} that are nearly identical to when using CFA-based estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the OMEGA macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale.},

  abstract = {This article provides a roadmap to assist graduate students and their advisors to engage in open science practices. We suggest eight open science practices that novice graduate students could begin adopting today. The topics we cover include journal clubs, project workflow, preprints, reproducible code, data sharing, transparent writing, preregistration, and registered reports. To address concerns about not knowing how to engage in open science practices, we provide a difficulty rating of each behavior (easy, medium, difficult), present them in order of suggested adoption, and follow the format of what, why, how, and worries. We give graduate students ideas on how to approach conversations with their advisors/collaborators, ideas on how to integrate open science practices within the graduate school framework, and specific resources on how to engage with each behavior. We emphasize that engaging in open science behaviors need not be an all or nothing approach, but rather graduate students can engage with any number of the behaviors outlined.},

  abstract = {The credibility of scientific claims depends upon the transparency of the research products upon which they are based (e.g., study protocols, data, materials, and analysis scripts). As psychology navigates a period of unprecedented introspection, user-friendly tools and services that support open science have flourished. However, the plethora of decisions and choices involved can be bewildering. Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research (e.g., choosing a repository, preparing their research products for sharing, structuring folders, etc.). Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows. Further, this adoption can be piecemeal -- each incremental step towards complete transparency adds positive value. Transparent research practices not only improve the efficiency of individual researchers, they enhance the credibility of the knowledge generated by the scientific community.},

  abstract = {Missing data and ordinal indicators are common in applied research involving latent constructs. Unfortunately, ordinal indicators violate the linearity assumption for conventional CFA that is routinely used to provide structural validity evidence for measurement instruments. Although robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) can deal with both missing data and nonnormality, it is generally inappropriate for ordinal indicators. Categorical estimation methods such as weighted least square mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) method, or MLR or maximum likelihood (ML) that justly treats ordinal indicators as categorical (MLR-CAT or ML-CAT, respectively) have been recommended for ordinal dependent variables. However, performances of these categorical estimators in the presence of missing data have not been empirically examined. The current study systematically investigates the relative performances of WLSMV, MLR, MLR-CAT, and ML-CAT under different conditions of missing data amount and mechanism, sample size, level of indicator distribution, and number of indicator categories. Results generally favor MLR-CAT so long as the sample size is not too small ({$>$}200) to result in convergence problems.},

  abstract = {In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the use of maximum likelihood (ML) assumes that the observed indicators follow a continuous and multivariate normal distribution, which is not appropriate for ordinal observed variables. Robust ML (MLR) has been introduced into CFA models when this normality assumption is slightly or moderately violated. Diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV), on the other hand, is specifically designed for ordinal data. Although WLSMV makes no distributional assumptions about the observed variables, a normal latent distribution underlying each observed categorical variable is instead assumed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to compare the effects of different configurations of latent response distributions, numbers of categories, and sample sizes on model parameter estimates, standard errors, and chi-square test statistics in a correlated two-factor model. The results showed that WLSMV was less biased and more accurate than MLR in estimating the factor loadings across nearly every condition. However, WLSMV yielded moderate overestimation of the interfactor correlations when the sample size was small or/and when the latent distributions were moderately nonnormal. With respect to standard error estimates of the factor loadings and the interfactor correlations, MLR outperformed WLSMV when the latent distributions were nonnormal with a small sample size of N = 200. Finally, the proposed model tended to be over-rejected by chi-square test statistics under both MLR and WLSMV in the condition of small sample size N = 200.},

A Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to compare the performance of ML, DWLS, and ULS in estimating model parameters, and their robust corrections to standard errors, and chi-square statistics in a structural equation model with ordinal observed variables. Eighty-four conditions, characterized by different ordinal observed distribution shapes, numbers of response categories, and sample sizes were investigated. Results reveal that (a) DWLS and ULS yield more accurate factor loading estimates than ML across all conditions; (b) DWLS and ULS produce more accurate interfactor correlation estimates than ML in almost every condition; (c) structural coefficient estimates from DWLS and ULS outperform ML estimates in nearly all asymmetric data conditions; (d) robust standard errors of parameter estimates obtained with robust ML are more accurate than those produced by DWLS and ULS across most conditions; and (e) regarding robust chi-square statistics, robust ML is inferior to DWLS and ULS in controlling for Type I error in almost every condition, unless a large sample is used (N = 1,000). Finally, implications of the findings are discussed, as are the limitations of this study as well as potential directions for future research.},

Despite their popularity, agreeing what value these indexes should attain to confidently decide between the acceptance and rejection of a model has been greatly debated. A recently proposed approach by means of equivalence testing has been recommended as a superior way to evaluate the goodness of fit of models. The approach has also been proposed as providing a necessary vehicle that can be used to advance the inferential nature of structural equation modeling as a confirmatory tool. The purpose of this article is to introduce readers to key ideas in equivalence testing and illustrate its use for conducting model--data fit assessments. Two confirmatory factor analysis models in which a priori specified latent variable models with known structure and tested against data are used as examples. It is advocated that whenever the goodness of fit of a model is to be assessed researchers should always examine the resulting values obtained via the equivalence testing approach.},

Excess kurtosis is more likely the smaller the number of item response categories. As a result, fit is likely to improve as the number of item response categories decreases, regardless of the true underlying factor structure or {$\chi$}2-based fit index used to examine model fit. Equivalently, given a target value of approximate fit (e.g., root mean square error of approximation {$\leq$}.05) a model with more factors is needed to reach it as the number of categories increases. This is true regardless of whether the data are treated as continuous (common factor analysis) or as discrete (ordinal factor analysis). We recommend using a large number of response alternatives ({$\geq$} 5) to increase the power to detect incorrect substantive models.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies in psychology commonly report Cronbach's alpha as a measure of internal consistency reliability despite the fact that many methodological studies have shown that Cronbach's alpha is riddled with problems stemming from unrealistic assumptions. In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach's alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach's alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach's alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach's alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach's alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach's alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle's omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods.},

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of traditional fit index cutoffs like RMSEA {$\leq$} .06 and CFI {$\geq$} .95, several studies have noted issues with overgeneralizing traditional cutoffs. Computational methods have been proposed to avoid overgeneralization by deriving cutoffs specifically tailored to characteristics of the model being evaluated. Simulations show favorable performance of these methods; however, these methods support a narrow set of models and response scales (i.e., only continuous variables) and interpretation of cutoffs is not always standardized, which affects empirical researchers' ability to confidently and broadly adopt these methods to evaluate model fit. In this paper, we propose an extension to one recently developed computational method---dynamic fit index cutoffs---that (a) permits application to any covariance structure model (e.g., CFA, mediation, bifactor), (b) standardizes interpretation of cutoffs across any covariance structure model, and (c) supports normal, nonnormal, categorical, and missing data. Software is provided to facilitate implementation of the method.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a widespread and commonly used approach to test substantive hypotheses in the social and behavioral sciences. When performing hypothesis tests, it is vital to rely on a sufficiently large sample size to achieve an adequate degree of statistical power to detect the hypothesized effect. However, applications of SEM rarely consider statistical power in informing sample size considerations or determine the statistical power for the focal hypothesis tests performed. One reason is the difficulty in translating substantive hypotheses into specific effect size values required to perform power analyses, as well as the lack of user-friendly software to automate this process. The present paper presents the second version of the R package semPower which includes comprehensive functionality for various types of power analyses in SEM. Specifically, semPower 2 allows one to perform both analytical and simulated a priori, post hoc, and compromise power analysis for structural equation models with or without latent variables, and also supports multigroup settings and provides user-friendly convenience functions for many common model types (e.g., standard confirmatory factor analysis [CFA] models, regression models, autoregressive moving average [ARMA] models, cross-lagged panel models) to simplify power analyses when a model-based definition of the effect in terms of model parameters is desired.},

It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles, and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 2) the analysis exactly reproduces at a later point in time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Combining containerization, dependence management, version management, and dynamic document generation, the proposed workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.},

It is a building block for transparent and cumulative science because it enables the originator and other researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results came about, while avoiding a variety of errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical and computational results. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code, PAC). PAC eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several more advantages. Making technical advancements that serve reproducibility more widely accessible for researchers holds the potential to innovate the research process and to help it become more productive, credible, and reliable.},

Yet these concepts are often represented in a binary way as independent dichotomous categories. This is evident in many key textbooks which are used in research methods courses to guide students and newer researchers in their research training. This paper analyses such textbook representations of 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' in 25 key resources published in English (supported by an outline survey of 23 textbooks written in German, Spanish and French). We then compare these with the perceptions, gathered through semi-structured interviews, of university researchers (n\,=\,31) who work in a wide range of arts and science disciplines. The analysis of what the textbooks say compared to what the participants report they do in their practice shows some common features, as might be assumed, but there are significant contrasts and contradictions. The differences tend to align with some other recent literature to underline the complexity and connectivity associated with the terms. We suggest ways in which future research methods courses and newer researchers could question and positively deconstruct such binary representations in order to free up directions for research in practice, so that investigations can use both quantitative or qualitative approaches in more nuanced practices that are appropriate to the specific field and given context of investigations.},

First, we explore the meaning of the terms ``method'' and ``method bias'' and then we examine whether method biases influence all measures equally.

Data were generated from 2 models with 2-7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6-7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable. {\copyright} 2012 American Psychological Association.},

In this paper, we describe the concepts underlying internal structure and the statistical methods for gathering and analyzing internal structure. Method: An in-depth description of the traditional and modern techniques for evaluating the internal structure of an assessment. Results: Validity evidence based on the internal structure of an assessment is necessary for building a validity argument to support the use of a test for a particular purpose.

  abstract = {Confirmatory factor analysis is some of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social sciences. Frequently, variables (i.e., items) stemming from questionnaires are analyzed. Two competing approaches for estimating confirmatory factor analysis can be distinguished. First, ordinal variables could be treated as in the case of continuous variables using Pearson correlations, and maximum likelihood estimation method would be applied. Second, an ordinal factor analysis based on polychoric correlations can be fitted. In the majority of the psychometric literature, there is a preference for the ordinal factor analysis based on polychoric correlations because the continuous treatment of variables results in biased factor loadings and biased factor correlations. This article argues that it is not legitimate to speak about bias when comparing the two competing factor analytic approaches because it depends on how true model parameters are defined. This decision can be made individually by a researcher. It is shown in simulation studies and analytical derivations that treating variables ordinally using polychoric correlations instead of continuous using Pearson correlations can also lead to biased estimates of factor loadings and factor correlations. Consequently, it should only be stated that different model parameters are defined in a continuous and an ordinal treatment, and one approach should not generally be preferred over the other.},

Objective: the purpose of this article is to present the best practices and recent recommendations for a typical EFA in administration through a practical solution accessible to researchers. Methods: in this sense, in addition to discussing current practices versus recommended practices, a tutorial with real data on Factor is illustrated. The Factor software is still little known in the administration area, but is freeware, easy-to-use (point and click), and powerful. The step-by-step tutorial illustrated in the article, in addition to the discussions raised and an additional example, is also available in the format of tutorial videos. Conclusion: through the proposed didactic methodology (article-tutorial + video-tutorial), we encourage researchers/methodologists who have mastered a particular technique to do the same. Specifically about EFA, we hope that the presentation of the Factor software, as a first solution, can transcend the current outdated rules of thumb and heuristics, by making best practices accessible to administration researchers.},

Hence, it is important to examine the nature of latent variables, the inter-relationships among such variables, and their associations with other predictors and outcome variables. These latent variable-related issues can be well addressed by adopting the approach of structural equation modeling. Apart from describing the use of structural equation modeling in research on human development, this paper also presents the assumptions underlying structural equation modeling, steps of model construction and model assessment, and both the strengths and limitations of this method in human development research.

We considered different types and levels of misspecification in factor analysis models: misspecified dimensionality, omitting cross-loadings, and ignoring residual correlations. Estimation methods had substantial impacts on the RMSEA and CFI so that different cutoff values need to be employed for different estimators. In contrast, SRMR is robust to the method used to estimate the model parameters. The same criterion can be applied at the population level when using the SRMR to evaluate model fit, regardless of the choice of estimation method.},

The performance of PD and MI are compared under a wide range of conditions, including number of response categories, sample size, percent of missingness, and degree of model misfit. Results indicate that both PD and MI yield parameter estimates similar to those from analysis of complete data under conditions where the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). When the data are missing at random (MAR), PD parameter estimates are shown to be severely biased across parameter combinations in the study. When the percentage of missingness is less than 50\%, MI yields parameter estimates that are similar to results from complete data. However, the fit indices (i.e., {$\chi$}               2               , RMSEA, and WRMR) yield estimates that suggested a worse fit than results observed in complete data.

The current (biased) implementation for the RMSEA never rejects that a model fits closely when data are binary and almost invariably rejects the model in large samples if data consist of five categories. The unbiased RMSEA produces better rejection rates, but it is only accurate enough when the number of variables is small and the degree of misfit is small. In contrast, across all simulated conditions, the tests of close fit based on the SRMR yield acceptable type I error rates. SRMR tests of close fit are also more powerful than those using the unbiased RMSEA.},

This paper introduces the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS): A step-by-step procedure that researchers can follow to make a research project open and reproducible. This workflow intends to lower the threshold for adoption of open science principles. It is based on established best practices, and can be used either in parallel to, or in absence of, top-down requirements by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. To facilitate widespread adoption, the WORCS principles have been implemented in the R package worcs, which offers an RStudio project template and utility functions for specific workflow steps. This paper introduces the conceptual workflow, discusses how it meets different standards for open science, and addresses the functionality provided by the R implementation, worcs. This paper is primarily targeted towards scholars conducting research projects in R, conducting research that involves academic prose, analysis code, and tabular data. However, the workflow is flexible enough to accommodate other scenarios, and offers a starting point for customized solutions.

As power analysis becomes standard practice in many fields of psychology, researchers who use SEM for data analysis can benefit from knowing how to conduct power analysis for their studies. With this article, I offer a gentle, practical introduction to power analysis for SEM. First, I connect two goals that researchers often have when using SEM---to interpret the overall model and to detect target effects within the model---to power analysis. Then, I conceptually describe power to detect target effects and power to detect model misfit, summarizing what determines each and common approaches to conducting each type of power analysis. Finally, I provide an illustrative example of conducting power analysis for SEM with a concrete research scenario. Throughout the article, I prioritize plain language and practical guidance over technical depth, with the hope that it makes power analysis for SEM less daunting.},

The revolutionary change took place along with the release of the 1999 Standards followed by the 2014 Standards in which validity is associated with interpretation and use of test scores. With the new framework, several types of theoretical and empirical evidence are required to support the validation process. The results of the analysis show that the drastic change of the validity concept and the complicated process of validation have resulted in misunderstanding, misinterpretation, and misuse. Apart from different views which challenge the new concept, the argument-based approach has provided basis for new studies in many fields. Some strategies required to deal with complicated validation processes are suggested, along with some alternative perspective associated with the limitations of the standards.

  abstract = {Abstract             There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

  abstract = {In structural equation modeling, application of the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker--Lewis index (TLI) highly relies on the conventional cutoff values developed under normal-theory maximum likelihood (ML) with continuous data. For ordered categorical data, unweighted least squares (ULS) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) based on polychoric correlation matrices have been recommended in previous studies. Although no clear suggestions exist regarding the application of these fit indices when analyzing ordered categorical variables, practitioners are still tempted to adopt the conventional cutoff rules. The purpose of our research was to answer the question: Given a population polychoric correlation matrix and a hypothesized model, if ML results in a specific RMSEA value (e.g.,.08), what is the RMSEA value when ULS or DWLS is applied? CFI and TLI were investigated in the same fashion. Both simulated and empirical polychoric correlation matrices with various degrees of model misspecification were employed to address the above question. The results showed that DWLS and ULS lead to smaller RMSEA and larger CFI and TLI values than does ML for all manipulated conditions, regardless of whether or not the indices are scaled. Applying the conventional cutoffs to DWLS and ULS, therefore, has a pronounced tendency not to discover model--data misfit. Discussions regarding the use of RMSEA, CFI, and TLI for ordered categorical data are given.},

  abstract = {Ordinal variables are common in many empirical investigations in the social and behavioral sciences. Researchers often apply the maximum likelihood method to fit structural equation models to ordinal data. This assumes that the observed measures have normal distributions, which is not the case when the variables are ordinal. A better approach is to use polychoric correlations and fit the models using methods such as unweighted least squares (ULS), maximum likelihood (ML), weighted least squares (WLS), or diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS). In this simulation evaluation we study the behavior of these methods in combination with polychoric correlations when the models are misspecified. We also study the effect of model size and number of categories on the parameter estimates, their standard errors, and the common chi-square measures of fit when the models are both correct and misspecified. When used routinely, these methods give consistent parameter estimates but ULS, ML, and DWLS give incorrect standard errors. Correct standard errors can be obtained for these methods by robustification using an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix W of the polychoric correlations. When used in this way the methods are here called RULS, RML, and RDWLS. {\copyright} Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {This simulation study evaluated CFA model results under violations of both distributional and structural assumptions using maximum likelihood (ML), robust maximum likelihood (RML), and weighted least square (WLS) estimation methods. Design factors included model complexity, the degree of non-normality of factor and error scores, sample sizes, and model misspecifications. In total, 72 conditions were used for data generation. Results were evaluated by rejection rate based on the model chi-square tests, fit function, CFI, RMSEA, and parameter estimates. Findings from the simulation study suggested that CFA results were robust to moderate violation of the non-normality of both factor and error scores under ML and RML methods, however, the degree of non-normality of factor scores impacted both overall model fit indices and loading estimates under WLS, particularly when the models were mis-specified. In addition, correctly specified and mis-specified models were likely detected by combining results from multiple estimation methods. Reference to this paper should be made as follows: Yang, Y. and Liang, X. (2013) 'Confirmatory factor analysis under violations of distributional and structural assumptions', Int.},

  abstract = {Conventional null hypothesis testing (NHT) is a very important tool if the ultimate goal is to find a difference or to reject a model. However, the purpose of structural equation modeling (SEM) is to identify a model and use it to account for the relationship among substantive variables. With the setup of NHT, a nonsignificant test statistic does not necessarily imply that the model is correctly specified or the size of misspecification is properly controlled. To overcome this problem, this article proposes to replace NHT by equivalence testing, the goal of which is to endorse a model under a null hypothesis rather than to reject it. Differences and similarities between equivalence testing and NHT are discussed, and new ``T-size'' terminology is introduced to convey the goodness of the current model under equivalence testing. Adjusted cutoff values of root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and comparative fit index (CFI) corresponding to those conventionally used in the literature are obtained to facilitate the understanding of T-size RMSEA and CFI. The single most notable property of equivalence testing is that it allows a researcher to confidently claim that the size of misspecification in the current model is below the T-size RMSEA or CFI, which gives SEM a desirable property to be a scientific methodology. R code for conducting equivalence testing is provided in an appendix.},
