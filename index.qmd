# Abstract {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This article aims to accomplish three objectives: first, to compile guidelines for the application of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), a widely utilized technique in applied social sciences; second, to demonstrate how these guidelines can be practically implemented through a real-world example; and third, to structure this narrative using tools that promote reproducibility, replicability, and transparency of results. To this end, we propose a solution in the form of a tutorial article wherein the key decisions made in conducting a CFA are validated through recent literature and presented within a dynamic document framework. This framework enables readers to access the article's source code, utilized data, analytical execution codes, and various reading media. We anticipate that by employing this pedagogical approach, developed entirely within an open environment (utilizing Git/Github/RStudio/Quarto/R packages + lavaan/Docker), researchers proficient in specific statistical techniques relevant to their domains will adopt and disseminate this proposal, thereby benefiting their colleagues.
